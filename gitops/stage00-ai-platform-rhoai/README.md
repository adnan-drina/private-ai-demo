# Stage 00: AI Platform - RHOAI

## Status: TODO

This stage is planned for future implementation and will include:
- OpenShift AI operator subscription
- DataScienceCluster CR with Model Registry enabled
- GPU Operator configuration
- GPU MachineSets (g6.4xlarge, g6.12xlarge)
- GPU MachineConfigs
- Model Registry + MySQL

## Current State

For now, these components should be deployed manually or via the OpenShift console.

## Future Work

GitOps manifests will be added here to automate:
1. Operator installations
2. GPU node provisioning
3. Model Registry setup

---

**Note:** Stage 0 prerequisites must be met before deploying Stages 1-4.
